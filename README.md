# Project Title

Basic Solidity contract that implements an ERC-20 token with minting and burning functions.

## Description

This code is a basic Solidity contract that implements a simple ERC-20 token with minting and burning functions. The contract has several public variables that hold information about the token, such as the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.

The contract also has a mapping variable that keeps track of the token balance for each address. The mint function allows for the creation of new tokens by increasing the total supply and increasing the balance of the provided address by the minted amount. The burn function allows for the destruction of tokens by reducing the total supply and the balance of the provided address by the burned amount, provided that the address has sufficient balance.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* A Solidity compiler, such as solc, to compile the contract code into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
* A development environment or IDE, such as Remix or Truffle, to write, test, and deploy the contract.

### Executing program

* Install a development environment or IDE, such as Remix, which is a web-based IDE for Solidity development. Remix allows you to write, compile, and deploy Solidity contracts directly from your browser. Alternatively, you can use Truffle, a popular development framework that provides a suite of tools for building and testing Ethereum applications.
* Once you have installed these tools, you can use them to compile, deploy, and interact with the Solidity contract. To deploy the contract, you will need to use an Ethereum client to connect to the Ethereum network and deploy the compiled bytecode to the network. Once the contract is deployed, you can use various tools to interact with it, such as Web3.js or ethers.js, which are JavaScript libraries for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
